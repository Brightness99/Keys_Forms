<h2>A curated curriculum</h2>
<i>Kana Keys</i> provides a carefully designed curriculum designed to make it easier than ever to master the kana. To learn the kana most efficiently, <b>follow the sequence given in the Main Menu</b>, first studying the Basics, then the Hiragana and Katakana Courses, then the section on <i>Gojūon</i> Collation Order, and finally the Comprehensive Tests.</p>

<p>The Hiragana and Katakana units are referred to as “courses” because they provide a <b>self-guiding, step-by-step curriculum</b>. Both courses begin with basic, unvoiced sounds, then cover voiced sounds, and conclude with a series of helpful tips on differentiating between easily confused kana. Within each kana set, tapping the “Study” link initiates a sequential lesson that progresses row-by-row through the set. The lessons teach you to <b>read, write, and pronounce each kana</b>, and familiarize you with a selection of useful example words that allow you to <b>learn kana within the context of authentic Japanese</b>. These example words incorporate only kana you have already learned, making the course <b>both streamlined and effortlessly self-reinforcing</b>.</p>

<p>Within the Katakana Course, the unit on <b>Transcription Katakana</b> teaches you a group of special katakana combinations used in the transcription of non-Japanese words. This unit - adapted from the set of transcription katakana recognized by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) - includes all the combinations you can expect to regularly encounter in reading Japanese.</p>

<p>While the built-in study sequence is designed to maximize your learning efficiency, the app also allows you <b>customize your learning</b> in various ways. To select specific rows of kana to study, simply tap on the rows’ initial consonants on the Lessons page. You can also study any of the individual kana from that page by tapping on it. The app also allows you to study and drill yourself on any kana you have recently missed, by using the “Recent Errors” test on the Main Menu. Finally, you can use the “Flag for Review” button to define your own review set, also accessible through the Main Menu.</p>


<p>To ensure you remember everything you study, <b>a review drill appears after every row</b> (usually consisting of 3-5 kana) <b>requiring you to both recognize and produce each kana</b> before proceeding further. These drills also require you to read and write complete Japanese words containing the kana you have just studied. Conveniently, these reading drills <b>continuously reinforce your knowledge of kana studied in previous rows</b>. These reading drills can also be used as vocabulary drills, if you require yourself to remember the English equivalents.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of each kana set, a varied sequence of <b>Lesson Tests</b> (kana-to-romaji, romaji-to-kana, fill in the blank, and timed recognition) ensures you have thoroughly mastered the set before proceeding to the next one. At the conclusion of the kana courses, a series of <b>Comprehensive Tests</b> ensures you are truly ready to meet the challenges of phonetic reading and writing in real-world Japanese.</p>

<p>An exceptional feature of this app is the lesson and exercise on <b><i>Gojūon</i> Collation</b>, an essential skill for organizing and locating information in Japanese.</p>

<h2>Which to study first – hiragana or katakana?</h2>
<p>In keeping with typical curricula for introductory Japanese courses, the Hiragana Course precedes the Katakana Course in the Main Menu. Yet the two courses are completely independent and non-cumulative (other than a handful of hiragana embedded in example words for katakana characters). If you are already in Japan or are about to travel there, consider studying the katakana first, as these will be more immediately useful to you. On the other hand, if you are enrolled in a Japanese course, there may be strong reasons to start with hiragana (consult with your teacher).</p>
