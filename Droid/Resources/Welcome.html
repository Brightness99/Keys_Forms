Japanese is a rich and fascinating language. Among its many extraordinary qualities is its unique script, which combines two parallel phonetic syllabaries (<i>kana</i>) with Chinese characters (<i>kanji</i>), Roman letters (<i>rōmaji</i>) and Arabic numerals (<i>Arabia sūji</i>). Mastering the kana is the essential first step in learning Japanese, meriting top priority so that the other aspects of the language can be studied <i>by means of</i> kana, rather than via the ill-advised expedient of rōmaji transliteration.</p>

<p>
This <i>Kana Keys</i> app is designed to ensure that you achieve advanced proficiency in reading, writing, and collating complete kana words. It also ensures that you master the standard rōmaji spellings required to input Japanese text on an alphabetical keyboard. </p>

<p>
<i>Kana Keys</i> is unique among kana learning tools for its comprehensive, self-guiding, and effortlessly self-reinforcing curriculum. Completing this 40-hour course of study will leave you better prepared for the rigors of reading, writing, and collating Japanese words than all but the most exceptional learners using conventional kana study tools.</p>
<p>
If you find the <i>Kana Keys</i> curriculum helpful, I invite you at its conclusion to take full advantage of my kanji course, currently available in print as <a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568365268/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1568365268&linkCode=as2&tag=lexicaglobal-20&linkId=MCDVK5XT3J35BBOQ">The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course: A Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering 2300 Characters</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lexicaglobal-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1568365268" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and soon available in the form of the <i>Kanji Keys</i> app. In either the print or app version, you will find the same meticulous care that has gone into developing this <i>Kana Keys</i> app, multiplied by a degree of magnitude corresponding to the 2,300 characters it contains. By developing a comprehensive, efficient, and pedagogically sound system for remembering kanji meanings and understanding how they are used in forming compounds, the kanji course makes it possible for all learners to attain genuine literacy in Japanese.</p>
<p>
Whatever path you choose to follow in learning Japanese, I welcome you to a challenging and extremely rewarding adventure, and wish you the very best.</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
